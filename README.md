# Notes

- This directory contains Raylib version 5.5 per [his Github page.](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.)
- It follows standard hierarchy practices.
- Given the nature of Raylib, all library and header files are stored locally.
	- Executables are built statically, so they can be shared by themselves.
- It's a simple game that follows a cube which tries not to be obliterated by a death ray.
- It's built using a pre-existing Raylib example.
