# death-ray

This is a simple, small demonstration made in Raylib, following a cube which tries not to be obliterated by a death ray.

It exists because I wanted to play with the Raylib engine.

# Requirements

- Functioning GPU and CPU hardware.
- Roughly 5 megabytes of available storage space.
- GCC or MinGW installed and running.

# Notes

- This contains Raylib version 5.5 per [his Github page.](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
- It follows standard hierarchy practices.
- Given the nature of Raylib, all library and header files are stored locally.
	- Executables are built statically.
- It's built using a pre-existing Raylib example.
